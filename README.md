# A course to prepare for solving algorithmic problems

Every week, I received exercises to do about specific algorithmic topics (See [Topics](#topics)).
Exercises came from [ACM-ICPC](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/) or [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/), where they were also validated.

I did this extra course while I was working in apprenticeship, so I couldn't assist to the classes. Every week, I planned a meeting with the teacher. During this meeting, we tested my last week code. If necessary, we corrected and optimised it with the help of the teacher.
